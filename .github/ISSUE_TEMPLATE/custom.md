<!--
  To make it easier for me to help you, please include as much useful information as possible.
  Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues https://github.com/timhagn/gatsby-background-image/issues
  
  And though I try to include new features right away, be aware, that not every
  one of them can be added to `gatsby-background-image` (especially if wanting
  to stay mostly on par with `gatsby-image`)...
