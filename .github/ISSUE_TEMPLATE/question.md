## Summary

## Relevant information

<!-- Provide as much useful information as you can -->

### Environment (if relevant)

<!--
  Required. Run `gatsby info --clipboard` in your gatsby project directory and 
  paste its contents here. Should your CLI of choice not support copying directly 
  to clipboard, just copy & paste `gatsby info`'s output here - both ways
  enclosing it with tripple backticks (```) would be great! 
-->

### File contents (if changed)

`package.json`: N/A <!-- Please use a code block or just leave it as is if wasn't changed -->
